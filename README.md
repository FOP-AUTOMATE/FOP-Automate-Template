# Automating the hell out of FOP using github actions

_I got tired of cloning the git repositories manually. It took me nearly one minute a time. So i took a few hours and automated it._

## Prerequisites

You need a github account (https://github.com/) and in best case the github education pack (https://education.github.com/pack)
(We wan't to run workflows on private repositories, so github for education makes sence)

Also you need to install gh client (https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

We use it to automatically create the repository (even less work, lazy sock ðŸ˜‰)

## _"Installation"_ (Linux/Mac)

### Using the setup script

Open the terminal and select a directory. In here a subdirectory will be created containing your workspace.
Type the following command:

```sh
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsc-de/FOP-Automate-Template/main/setup.sh)
```

The install script will ask you for all information needed and guide you through the process.

### Manual

- Use this template repository
- Clone the repository
- Open it with the text editor of your choice. In line 7-10 you wan't to change the information to match your information

  e.g.

  ```sh
  STUDENT_ID=hp81pfui
  FIRST_NAME=Harry
  LAST_NAME=Potter
  GITHUB_USERNAME=harry-potter
  ```

- Now we need to make the script executable:

  ```sh
  chmod +x create.sh
  ```

## _"Installation"_ (Windows)

### Using the setup script

Open the powershell and select a directory. In here a subdirectory will be created containing your workspace.

Now type the following command:

```ps
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsc-de/FOP-Automate-Template/main/setup.ps1'))"
```

The install script will ask you for all information needed and guide you through the process.

## Usage (Linux/Mac)

From the terminal we just type

```sh
./create.sh [Exercise]
```

e.g.

```sh
./create.sh FOP-2324-H00-Student
```

## Usage (Windows)

From the powershell we just type

```ps
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "./create.ps1 [Exercise]"
```

e.g.

```ps
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "./create.ps1 FOP-2324-H00-Student"
```

Sadly we can't just use ./create.ps1, because ExecutionPolicy is set to restricted by default.

if you wan't to change this, you can do so by typing

```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

But be aware that this is a security risk.

## Usage general

After running the create command, the git repository wil be created as `TU-FOP-2324-H00-Student` in this case and locally
will be put inside `TU-FOP-2324-H00-Student` (You can change the prefix `TU-` inside the settings section of the create.sh
file)

Now just import the local repository using IntelliJ

After committing and pushing to GitHub _(origin)_, you will find the release on your github repo's site
_it will take about a minute to build the submission_, be patient.

Click on the latest release and under `assets` download the jar. Note that after a push it will take about a minute for the
release to show up.

## Technical

The local repositories have two remotes registered, `origin` and `from`. In case you need to Merge changes done to the exercise
after you cloned it, you can do this via the from origin.

Also note that the github action will create a release for every commit pushed.
